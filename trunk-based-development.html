        A short explanation and example of how Trunk-Based Development is used

      <h2>What is Trunk-Based Development?</h2>
      <p>
        Trunk-Based Development is a source control workflow where developers
        collaborate on small, frequent changes directly against a single shared
        branch — commonly called the trunk, main, or master. The trunk remains
        the integration point for all changes and short-lived feature branches
        are merged quickly.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Example workflow</h2>
      <p>Example steps when using Git with Trunk-Based Development:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a short-lived branch from main</li>
        <li>Implement a small change and write tests.</li>
        <li>
          Run CI against the branch or trunk; when green, merge quickly into
          main.
        </li>
        <li>Deploy small, frequent releases from main (often continuously).</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

      <h2>Visual branching example</h2>
      <p>
        The diagram below illustrates a typical trunk-based flow: short-lived
        feature branches merge back into main frequently.

      <h2>Why teams use Trunk-Based Development</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduces long-lived merge conflicts.</li>
        <li>Encourages continuous integration and frequent releases.</li>
        <li>
          Works well with feature flags and automated testing to keep trunk
          deployable.
