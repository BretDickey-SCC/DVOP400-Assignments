    <h1>Feature Branch Workflow in Git</h1>
    <p><strong>By Tristan Johnson</strong> 10/24/2025</p>
    <p>
        The Feature Branch Workflow is a popular Git strategy that helps teams keep their codebase clean, stable, and
        organized. Instead of working directly on the <code>main</code> branch, developers spin off dedicated branches
        for each new feature or bugfix. This isolates changes, reduces conflicts, and makes collaboration smoother.
    </p>
    <p>
        In many setups, there's a <code>develop</code> branch that acts as a staging ground for new features. Developers
        create feature branches from <code>develop</code>, work independently, and then merge back into
        <code>develop</code> once the feature is complete. After integration testing, <code>develop</code> is merged
        into <code>main</code> for release.
    </p>
    <p>
        This workflow pairs perfectly with pull requests, continuous integration, and code reviews. It encourages clean
        commits, traceable history, and safer deploymentsâ€”especially when multiple features are in flight.
    </p>
    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
        Let's say you're building a login feature. Here's how the flow would look:
    <ol>
        <li>Start from the <code>develop</code> branch.</li>
        <li>Create a new branch called <code>feature/login</code>.</li>
        <li>Commit your changes to <code>feature/login</code>.</li>
        <li>Open a pull request to merge <code>feature/login</code> into <code>develop</code>.</li>
        <li>After testing and review, merge into <code>develop</code>.</li>
        <li>Once all features are ready, merge <code>develop</code> into <code>main</code> and tag the release (e.g.,
            <code>1.1.0</code>).
        </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
